                    <p>
                        The Department of Computer Engineering was formally created in 1997 with the approval of
                        the Statutes of the
                        School of Technology and Management (Escola Superior de Tecnologia e Gestão - ESTG),
                        but its origins lie in the area of Computer Science that has existed at ESTG
                        since it began operating in the 1989/90 academic year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Department of Computer Engineering is a functional unit of the ESTG to which
                        teachers,
                        laboratories and support services related to the teaching of
                        computer engineering are assigned.
                        The Department of Computer Engineering is responsible for a number of undergraduate,
                        master's and postgraduate
                        courses, as well as the recently created Higher Professional Technical Courses. It is
                        also responsible for teaching
                        various curricular units in the area of Computer Science that are part of the curriculum
                        of other courses taught at
                        ESTG. The activities carried out by the the Department of Computer Engineering follow
                        the strategic guidelines
                        defined by ESTG's bodies (Scientific Council, Pedagogical Council and Management).

                    <p>
                        The Master's course in Computer Engineering - Mobile Computing has been recognized by
                        ENAEE (European Network for
                        Accreditation of Engineering Education) through the award of the EUR-ACE® Quality Mark.
                        The distinction places the
                        quality of teaching in this course at the Polytechnic of Leiria at the level of the best
                        European universities and
                        polytechnics, and confirms the international dimension of the School's diplomas,
                        encouraging greater acceptance of
                        engineers graduating from the Polytechnic of Leiria throughout Europe.
