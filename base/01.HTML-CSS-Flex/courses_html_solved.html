                                The Higher Professional Technical course in Computer Technologies course aims to train professionals who, autonomously
                                or as part of a team, have the ability to design, model, implement and maintain information systems to support
                                organizations, based on emerging computer technologies and those existing on the market, in order to optimize
                                organizations' business processes. The professional with this training should have a high level of specialization in
                                digital technologies and applications, namely SAP, OutSystems, Navision, Java, RPA (Robotic Process Automation), among
                                others, enabling the creation of greater added value in organizations and the economy. The academic curriculum of the
                                course will be very practical, allowing students to work in a real environment, which means carrying out activities and
                                joining teams on small projects. Their time will be divided between teaching activities and practical work in a real
                                environment.
